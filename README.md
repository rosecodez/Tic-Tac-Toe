# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe was a really difficult project for a beginner especially when trying to decide the winner with an Ai system. I asked for help a lot in the Odin community and also my whole code becamse messier at some point, but it was a great practice again, after learning factory functions and module. Did not really do anything with the `getName` finally, since it was a simple game, but it was a good practice to store pretty much everything that I mostly used throughout the code, like `squares` variable.
Difficulties encountered:
- trying to make an Ai choose the O randomly was really difficult;
- PvP would have been a lot more easier when deciding the winner combinations for conditionals;
- creating the 2 images for `x` and `o` and assigning in innerHTMl, at first, gave me some problems reading about `Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB)`, after reasearching about that, which I don't know anything about it so far, made me use just the simple `appendChild` instead, but it was still very messy to use an image and just used strings;
- initially, I have chosen to let the user choose if he/she wants to go with `x` or `o`. I have done that easily creating an `x` button and inside that `addEventListener` I have built the code for handling the `user` having `x` and the `computer` having `o`, so for the `o` button the same pattern but reversed - that actually seemed like a really good idea for me at first, but the more i kept building I realised it is too much for how little I have learned yet, therefore i decided to just let the player be `x` and computer `o`;
